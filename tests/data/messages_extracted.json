This versatility allows for a wide range of dishes with different tastes and textures.\n\n4. **Influence and Adaptation**: Being from Guangdong province, particularly Guangzhou (formerly Canton), Cantonese cuisine has been heavily influenced by its status as a major trading port. This has led to the incorporation of various culinary elements from other cultures, making it more diverse.\n\n5. **Flavor Profile**: While Cantonese cuisine tends to be milder compared to some other Chinese cuisines, it offers a balance of flavors\u2014sweet, savory, sour, and umami. This allows for a wide range of dishes that cater to different tastes.\n\n6. **Popularity Abroad**: Cantonese cuisine is the most widely represented Chinese cuisine globally. This international exposure has led to further diversification and adaptation, integrating local ingredients and preferences from around the world.\n\nOverall, Cantonese cuisine\u2019s emphasis on variety, adaptability, and broad use of ingredients and techniques make it the most diverse among the eight major Chinese cuisines.",

Here are the key purposes of RAG:\n\n1. **Improving Accuracy**: RAG models use retrieved documents from a large corpus to provide more precise and factually correct responses, reducing the likelihood of generating incorrect or fabricated information.\n\n2. **Enhanced Contextual Understanding**: By incorporating relevant external information, RAG models can better understand and respond to complex queries that require context beyond the training data of the language model.\n\n3. **Reducing Hallucination**: Traditional language models sometimes generate plausible-sounding but incorrect or nonsensical information (hallucinations). RAG mitigates this by grounding responses in real-world data.\n\n4. **Expanding Knowledge Base**: RAG models can access up-to-date information and a broader range of knowledge than what is contained within the language model\u2019s training data, making them more versatile and informative.\n\n5. **Versatility in Applications**:\n   - **Question Answering**: Providing accurate answers based on a vast amount of external knowledge.\n   - **Content Generation**: Creating well-informed and factually grounded articles, summaries, or reports.\n   - **Conversational Agents**: Enhancing chatbot interactions with relevant and accurate information retrieval, leading to more meaningful and informed conversations.\n\n6. **Scalability**: RAG can efficiently handle large-scale information retrieval and generation tasks, making it suitable for applications requiring the synthesis of information from extensive datasets.\n\nBy combining retrieval and generation, RAG leverages the best of both worlds, creating a more powerful tool for generating high-quality, informed, and contextually appropriate text.",

Even though this new launch seems far away, this does not necessarily mean that OpenAI won\\u2019t continue to improve GPT-4.\\n\\nOpenAI is most likely to keep improving GPT-4, and we might see the introduction of an intermediary update, GPT-4.5, as we already saw with GPT-3.5.\\n\\n## What Features Can We Expect From GPT-5?\\n\\nWith GPT-5's release possibly a year or two in the future, most predictions about its advancements are based on current trends shaped by Google and open-source AI initiatives. These developments give us valuable insights into the future direction of the industry.\\n\\nHowever, there are some first clues coming directly from the OpenAI core team. During Gates's interview, Altman highlighted that OpenAI's efforts would concentrate on enhancing reasoning abilities and incorporating video processing capabilities.\\n\\nSo, let\\u2019s try to make a little sense of it all and discuss some key enhancements expected from GPT-5.\\n\\n### Parameter size\\n\\nWhile the exact parameter size of GPT-4 remains under wraps, there\\u2019s an ongoing trend toward more complex and capable models. Most sources indicate the number might be around 1.5 trillion parameters.\\n\\n[Image 1: Image by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution.]\\n\\nImage by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution. \\n\\nIf this trajectory continues, GPT-5 could redefine the limits of current LLMs, offering an unprecedented size.\\n\\n### Multimodality\\n\\nGiven that the existing GPT-4 model \\u301051\\u2020already supports speech\\u3011 and \\u301052\\u2020image functionalities,\\u3011 the integration of video processing emerges as a natural progression for GPT-5. We\\u2019ve already seen Google start to experiment with this feature in its Gemini model, so it\\u2019s only a matter of time before competition forces OpenAI to innovate as well.\\n\\nTherefore, GPT-5 could improve current GPT-4 multimodal capabilities and add new features like video integration, generating a pivotal shift in how we interact with AI, enabling more natural and versatile forms of communication.\\n\\n### From Chatbot to Agent\\n\\nThe transition from chatbots to fully autonomous agents is another exciting frontier. Imagine if you could assign menial tasks or jobs to a GPT-powered app. This could actually become a reality if OpenAI keeps integrating third-party services. We\\u2019ve already seen the introduction of \\u301053\\u2020Custom GPTs\\u3011, and this will likely continue to develop.\\n\\nThis new feature would allow GPT-5 to connect to various services and perform actions in the world seamlessly, acting on behalf of users to accomplish tasks without direct human oversight. For instance, we could ask an autonomous agent to buy our groceries based on our own dietary preferences.\\n\\n### Better accuracy\\n\\nWith each iteration, the accuracy of GPT models has improved, making them more reliable in understanding context and generating appropriate responses. A next generation in the GPT models would mean an increase in its training dataset size and variety.\\n\\nThe current \\u301054\\u2020GPT-4 model is 40% better than its predecessor GPT-3\\u2020openai.com\\u3011, so GPT-5 is expected to continue this trend, reducing errors and enhancing the fidelity of its interactions.\\n\\n### Increased context windows\\n\\nOne of the limitations of current models is the size of the context window they can consider for generating responses. Given that GPT-5 might be trained with a larger amount of data, it is anticipated to have an expanded context window, allowing it to understand and reference larger portions of text, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\n### Cost-effective use of the OpenAI API\\n\\nAs newer models emerge, we can also anticipate a reduction in the cost of using the OpenAI API, making technologies like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 more accessible. A launch of GPT-5 could mean that GPT-4 will become accessible and cheaper to use.\\n\\nThis democratization of access could spur a wave of innovation, enabling a broader range of developers and organizations to integrate advanced AI into their applications.\\n\\nOnce it becomes cheaper and more accessible, the GPT models could become more proficient at performing complex tasks like coding or research. If you haven\\u2019t tried OpenAI\\u2019s API yet, I strongly recommend you follow DataCamp\\u2019s\\u301055\\u2020 guide to the OpenAI API\\u3011 to get a taste of it.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile we eagerly await concrete details about GPT-5, it's crucial to remember that our current discussions are rooted in speculation and mere prediction based on historical facts, AI general trends, and some small clues that OpenAI\\u2019s team seems to share.\\n\\nHistory suggests that we may see incremental updates, such as a GPT-4.5, before the arrival of GPT-5 in the mid-term.\\n\\nRegardless of the timeline, the evolution of the GPT series continues to captivate the imagination, promising a future where AI's potential is limited only by our ability to envision its applications.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re eager to get started exploring all that GPT models have to offer, start with our \\u301056\\u2020Introduction to ChatGPT\\u3011 course or, if you\\u2019re already familiar with the model, our webinar on \\u301057\\u2020Using ChatGPT\\u2019s Advanced Data Analysis\\u3011.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[Image 2: Photo of Josep Ferrer]\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nJosep Ferrer\\n\\n\\u301058\\u2020.css-18aqazp{-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;border-radius:50%;height:28px;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify\", \"pub_date\": null, \"extra\": null}], \"original_query\": null}, \"command\": \"mclick\", \"args\": [\"[0, 2, 3, 12, 19]\"], \"status\": \"finished\", \"is_complete\": true, \"message_type\": null, \"model_slug\": \"gpt-4o\", \"default_model_slug\": \"gpt-4o\", \"parent_id\": \"de1b34d3-fbee-4758-9bd3-baf24252dc12\", \"request_id\": \"8ad0738db96b928c-MUC\", \"timestamp_\": \"absolute\"}",

We don\\u2019t know exactly what this will be, but by way of an idea, the jump from\\u00a0GPT-3\\u2019s 175 billion parameters to GPT-4\\u2019s reported 1.5 trillion is an 8-9x increase.\\n\\nWhether or not OpenAI can match that remains to be seen, but a law of diminishing returns could be emerging based on the fact that the 115x jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 is almost certainly never going to be repeated.\\n\\nIf OpenAI can approach a 4-5x parameter increase with GPT-5, it would be a phenomenal accomplishment, especially when you consider that the latest industry benchmark, Anthropic\\u2019s Claude 3 Opus, is a 2 trillion parameter model, so even doubling the parameters of GPT-4 would be an impressive feat.\\n\\nBecause we\\u2019re talking in the trillions here, the impact of any increase will be eye-catching. It\\u2019s also safe to expect GPT-5 to have a larger context window and more current knowledge cut-off date, with an outside chance it might even be able to process certain information (such as social media sources) in real-time.\\n\\n### Sora and Multimodality at the Fore of GPT-5 \\n\\nAs excited as people are for the seemingly imminent launch of GPT-4.5, there\\u2019s even more interest in OpenAI\\u2019s recently announced text-to-video generator, dubbed \\u301040\\u2020Sora\\u3011.\\n\\nSora is the latest salvo in OpenAI\\u2019s quest to build true multimodality into its products right now, ChatGPT Plus (the chatbot\\u2019s paid tier, costing $20 a month) offers integration with OpenAI\\u2019s DALL-E \\u301048\\u2020AI image generator\\u3011. It lets you make \\u201coriginal\\u201d AI images simply by inputting a text prompt into ChatGPT.\\n\\nWith Sora, you\\u2019ll be able to do the same, only you\\u2019ll get a video output instead. The early displays of Sora\\u2019s powers have sent the internet into a frenzy, and even after more than 10 years of seeing tech\\u2019s \\u201cnext big thing\\u201d come and go, I have to say it\\u2019s wildly impressive.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s every chance Sora could make its way into public beta or ChatGPT Plus availability before GPT-5 is even released, but even if that\\u2019s the case, it\\u2019ll be bigger and better than ever when OpenAI\\u2019s next-gen LLM does finally land.\\n\\n[Image 4: Screenshot of Sora video showing woman walking through Tokyo at night] \\n\\n### GPT-5 Could Usher in Project Q* Era of AGI \\n\\nOf course, in any discussion of GPT-5 it\\u2019s impossible to ignore the fact that, behind the scenes, OpenAI is working to develop not only its current suite of AI products, but also to bring forth a new breed of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) technologies currently dubbed \\u301049\\u2020Project Q*\\u3011.\\n\\nAGI is the term given when AI becomes \\u201csuperintelligent,\\u201d or gains the capacity to learn, reason and make decisions with human levels of cognition. It basically means that AGI systems are able to operate completely independent of learned information, thereby moving a step closer to being sentient beings.\\n\\nWhen current AI technologies can\\u2019t seem to stop themselves hallucinating information or generating the odd \\u301050\\u2020racist image\\u3011 for japes, it\\u2019s a hugely controversial prospect to say the least and is being opposed by many within the industry on ethical grounds.\\n\\nNevertheless, OpenAI is one of its chief proponents and with the next major GPT release, GPT-5, there\\u2019s a chance we\\u2019ll learn more about its ultimate aims for Project Q* AGI superintelligence, if not see a finished product, as per Altman\\u2019s own statements.\\n\\n### GPT-6 Also \\u201cConfirmed\\u201d by OpenAI \\n\\nWhy just get ahead of ourselves when we can get completely ahead of ourselves? In another statement, this time dated back to a Y Combinator event last September, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman referenced the development not only of GPT-5 but also its successor, GPT-6.\\n\\nHe stated that both were still a ways off in terms of release; both were targeting greater reliability at a lower cost; and as we just hinted above, both would fall short of being classified as AGI products.\\n\\n> Building in AI?

Improved reasoning\\n\\n[Image 3: GPT-5- Improved reasoning ]\\n\\nWe cannot say that AI cannot reason, with high computation and calculation power they are capable of generating human-like intelligence and interactions. This capability will be enhanced with the upcoming GPT models.\\u00a0\\n\\nSam Altman said they will be focusing on improving reasoning ability. The GPT-4o model has enhanced reasoning capability on par with GPT-4 Turbo with 87.2% accurate answers.\\u00a0\\n\\nHowever, GPT-5 will be trained on even more data and will show more accurate results with high-end computation.\\n\\n### 4. Larger context windows\\n\\nContext windows refer to how many tokens a model can process in a single go. A bigger context window means the model can absorb more data from given inputs, generating more accurate data. Currently, GPT-4o has a context window of 128,000 tokens which is smaller than\\u00a0 \\u301060\\u2020Google\\u2019s Gemini model\\u2019s\\u2020blog.google\\u3011 context window of up to 1 million tokens.\\u00a0\\n\\nAs per Alan Thompson\\u2019s prediction, there will be a whopping increase of 300x tokens. This could change the course of the Gemini model, offering notable advancement.\\u00a0\\n\\n### 5. Enhanced customization capabilities\\n\\nAltman said they will improve customization and personalization for GPT for every user. Currently, ChatGPT Plus or premium users can build and use custom settings, enabling users to personalize a GPT as per a specific task, from teaching a board game to helping kids complete their homework.\\n\\nIn the later interactions, developers can use user\\u2019s personal data, email, calendar, book appointments, and others. However, customization is not at the forefront of the next update, GPT-5, but you will see significant changes.\\n\\n### 6. Increased parameter size\\n\\nFrom GPT-1 to GPT-4, there has been a rise in the number of parameters they are trained on, GPT-5 is no exception. The size of these parameters affects how well the model can learn from data. OpenAI hasn\\u2019t revealed the exact number of parameters for GPT-5, but it\\u2019s estimated to have about 1.5 trillion parameters. This is a huge jump from GPT-3\\u2019s 175 billion and GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion.\\n\\n[Image 4: GPT-5- Increased Parameter Size ]\\n\\nAI expert \\u301061\\u2020Alan Thompson\\u2020lifearchitect.ai\\u3011, who advises Google and Microsoft, thinks GPT-5 might have 2-5 trillion parameters. He bases this on the increase in computing power and training time since GPT-4.\\n\\n### 7. Increased reliability\\n\\nImproving reliability is another focus of GPT\\u2019s improvement over the next two years, so you will see better reliable outputs with the Gpt-5 model.\\u00a0\\n\\nIn the case of the GPT-4, Altman says, \\u201cIf you ask GPT-4 the same question 10,000 times, one answer will probably be good, but it can\\u2019t always pick the best one. You\\u2019d want it to give the best response every time, so making it more reliable is important.\\u201d\\n\\nIn GPT-4o the reliability improved, reducing AI hallucinations. So, we are hoping GPT-5 to be more reliable and stable.\\n\\n[Also Read: \\u301062\\u2020How to Use AIML In Chatbot Development with Python?\\u3011]\\n\\n## When can we expect GPT5 release?\\n\\nIt is estimated to be in the market and available in 2024. Some are suggesting that the release is delayed due to the upcoming U.S. election, with a release date closer to November or December 2024.\\n\\nConsidering the training period of around 4-6 months (double of GPT-4 training time), the new model will take time in reinforcement learning, red teaming, and further testing before being released.\\n\\n## How much does GPT5 cost?\\n\\nIf OpenAI keeps its usual pricing, using GPT-5 will be expensive. ChatGPT with GPT-4 costs $20/month, while GPT-3.5 is free.\\n\\n[Image 5: How much does GPT-5 cost? ]\\n\\nFor the API, GPT-4 costs $30 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens (double for the 32k version). If GPT5 is as powerful as expected, it will cost more than previous models.\\n\\nHowever, the latest OpenAI model, GPT-4o, is much cheaper. It costs only $5 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. While pricing isn\\u2019t a big issue for large companies, this move makes it more accessible for individuals and small businesses.\\n\\n## The future of ChatGPT\\n\\nAs Altman said, we just scratched the surface of AI and this is just the beginning. There is much more to explore and improve the AI capabilities. GPT5 is just a step closer in the race of AI intelligence.\\u00a0\\n\\nAGI: The Ultimate Goal\\n\\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to AI that understands, learns, and performs tasks at a human-like level without extensive supervision. AGI has the potential to handle simple tasks, like ordering food online, as well as complex problem-solving requiring strategic planning. OpenAI\\u2019s dedication to AGI suggests a future where AI can independently manage tasks and make significant decisions based on user-defined goals.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### Q.

Even though this new launch seems far away, this does not necessarily mean that OpenAI won\\u2019t continue to improve GPT-4.\\n\\nOpenAI is most likely to keep improving GPT-4, and we might see the introduction of an intermediary update, GPT-4.5, as we already saw with GPT-3.5.\\n\\n## What Features Can We Expect From GPT-5?\\n\\nWith GPT-5's release possibly a year or two in the future, most predictions about its advancements are based on current trends shaped by Google and open-source AI initiatives. These developments give us valuable insights into the future direction of the industry.\\n\\nHowever, there are some first clues coming directly from the OpenAI core team. During Gates's interview, Altman highlighted that OpenAI's efforts would concentrate on enhancing reasoning abilities and incorporating video processing capabilities.\\n\\nSo, let\\u2019s try to make a little sense of it all and discuss some key enhancements expected from GPT-5.\\n\\n### Parameter size\\n\\nWhile the exact parameter size of GPT-4 remains under wraps, there\\u2019s an ongoing trend toward more complex and capable models. Most sources indicate the number might be around 1.5 trillion parameters.\\n\\n[Image 1: Image by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution.]\\n\\nImage by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution. \\n\\nIf this trajectory continues, GPT-5 could redefine the limits of current LLMs, offering an unprecedented size.\\n\\n### Multimodality\\n\\nGiven that the existing GPT-4 model \\u301051\\u2020already supports speech\\u3011 and \\u301052\\u2020image functionalities,\\u3011 the integration of video processing emerges as a natural progression for GPT-5. We\\u2019ve already seen Google start to experiment with this feature in its Gemini model, so it\\u2019s only a matter of time before competition forces OpenAI to innovate as well.\\n\\nTherefore, GPT-5 could improve current GPT-4 multimodal capabilities and add new features like video integration, generating a pivotal shift in how we interact with AI, enabling more natural and versatile forms of communication.\\n\\n### From Chatbot to Agent\\n\\nThe transition from chatbots to fully autonomous agents is another exciting frontier. Imagine if you could assign menial tasks or jobs to a GPT-powered app. This could actually become a reality if OpenAI keeps integrating third-party services. We\\u2019ve already seen the introduction of \\u301053\\u2020Custom GPTs\\u3011, and this will likely continue to develop.\\n\\nThis new feature would allow GPT-5 to connect to various services and perform actions in the world seamlessly, acting on behalf of users to accomplish tasks without direct human oversight. For instance, we could ask an autonomous agent to buy our groceries based on our own dietary preferences.\\n\\n### Better accuracy\\n\\nWith each iteration, the accuracy of GPT models has improved, making them more reliable in understanding context and generating appropriate responses. A next generation in the GPT models would mean an increase in its training dataset size and variety.\\n\\nThe current \\u301054\\u2020GPT-4 model is 40% better than its predecessor GPT-3\\u2020openai.com\\u3011, so GPT-5 is expected to continue this trend, reducing errors and enhancing the fidelity of its interactions.\\n\\n### Increased context windows\\n\\nOne of the limitations of current models is the size of the context window they can consider for generating responses. Given that GPT-5 might be trained with a larger amount of data, it is anticipated to have an expanded context window, allowing it to understand and reference larger portions of text, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\n### Cost-effective use of the OpenAI API\\n\\nAs newer models emerge, we can also anticipate a reduction in the cost of using the OpenAI API, making technologies like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 more accessible. A launch of GPT-5 could mean that GPT-4 will become accessible and cheaper to use.\\n\\nThis democratization of access could spur a wave of innovation, enabling a broader range of developers and organizations to integrate advanced AI into their applications.\\n\\nOnce it becomes cheaper and more accessible, the GPT models could become more proficient at performing complex tasks like coding or research. If you haven\\u2019t tried OpenAI\\u2019s API yet, I strongly recommend you follow DataCamp\\u2019s\\u301055\\u2020 guide to the OpenAI API\\u3011 to get a taste of it.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile we eagerly await concrete details about GPT-5, it's crucial to remember that our current discussions are rooted in speculation and mere prediction based on historical facts, AI general trends, and some small clues that OpenAI\\u2019s team seems to share.\\n\\nHistory suggests that we may see incremental updates, such as a GPT-4.5, before the arrival of GPT-5 in the mid-term.\\n\\nRegardless of the timeline, the evolution of the GPT series continues to captivate the imagination, promising a future where AI's potential is limited only by our ability to envision its applications.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re eager to get started exploring all that GPT models have to offer, start with our \\u301056\\u2020Introduction to ChatGPT\\u3011 course or, if you\\u2019re already familiar with the model, our webinar on \\u301057\\u2020Using ChatGPT\\u2019s Advanced Data Analysis\\u3011.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[Image 2: Photo of Josep Ferrer]\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nJosep Ferrer\\n\\n\\u301058\\u2020.css-18aqazp{-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;border-radius:50%;height:28px;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify\", \"pub_date\": null, \"extra\": {\"cited_message_idx\": 12, \"search_result_idx\": null, \"evidence_text\": \"source\", \"cloud_doc_url\": null}}}, {\"start_ix\": 382, \"end_ix\": 393, \"citation_format_type\": \"tether_og\", \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"webpage\", \"title\": \"GPT-5: Latest News, Updates and Everything We Know So Far\", \"url\": \"https://tech.co/news/gpt-5-preview-release-rumors\", \"text\": \"\\nThrow in the \\u301045\\u2020March 2024 Microsoft Surface event\\u3011 and you\\u2019ve even got a catwalk for GPT-4.5 to be initially teased, given Microsoft is one of OpenAI\\u2019s biggest partners, investors, and even sits on the company\\u2019s board.\\n\\n> It\\u2019s on the duck duck go one \\u301046\\u2020pic.twitter.com/7Jw45v8ybr\\u2020t.co\\u3011\\n> \\n> \\u2014 Matthew (@Matthew35342706) \\u301047\\u2020March 12, 2024\\u2020twitter.com\\u3011\\n\\n### GPT-5 Confirmed to be Under Development \\n\\nAs well as the likelihood that the release of GPT-4.5 by OpenAI is nearing, we also now have it confirmed that the company is indeed working on GPT-5, so its next-gen LLM is actually under development as opposed to just being an internet pipedream.\\n\\nOpenAI CEO Sam Altman revealed as much at the start of 2024, speaking to Bill Gates on the tech icon\\u2019s Unconfuse Me podcast.\\n\\n### Expect a Major Leap in GPT-5 Parameters vs GPT-4 \\n\\nNow, as we approach more speculative territory and GPT-5 rumors, another thing we know more or less for certain is that GPT-5 will offer significantly enhanced machine learning specs compared to GPT-4.\\n\\nThe headline one is likely to be its parameters, where a massive leap is expected as GPT-5\\u2019s abilities vastly exceed anything previous models were capable of. We don\\u2019t know exactly what this will be, but by way of an idea, the jump from\\u00a0GPT-3\\u2019s 175 billion parameters to GPT-4\\u2019s reported 1.5 trillion is an 8-9x increase.\\n\\nWhether or not OpenAI can match that remains to be seen, but a law of diminishing returns could be emerging based on the fact that the 115x jump from GPT-2 to GPT-3 is almost certainly never going to be repeated.\\n\\nIf OpenAI can approach a 4-5x parameter increase with GPT-5, it would be a phenomenal accomplishment, especially when you consider that the latest industry benchmark, Anthropic\\u2019s Claude 3 Opus, is a 2 trillion parameter model, so even doubling the parameters of GPT-4 would be an impressive feat.\\n\\nBecause we\\u2019re talking in the trillions here, the impact of any increase will be eye-catching. It\\u2019s also safe to expect GPT-5 to have a larger context window and more current knowledge cut-off date, with an outside chance it might even be able to process certain information (such as social media sources) in real-time.\\n\\n### Sora and Multimodality at the Fore of GPT-5 \\n\\nAs excited as people are for the seemingly imminent launch of GPT-4.5, there\\u2019s even more interest in OpenAI\\u2019s recently announced text-to-video generator, dubbed \\u301040\\u2020Sora\\u3011.\\n\\nSora is the latest salvo in OpenAI\\u2019s quest to build true multimodality into its products right now, ChatGPT Plus (the chatbot\\u2019s paid tier, costing $20 a month) offers integration with OpenAI\\u2019s DALL-E \\u301048\\u2020AI image generator\\u3011. It lets you make \\u201coriginal\\u201d AI images simply by inputting a text prompt into ChatGPT.\\n\\nWith Sora, you\\u2019ll be able to do the same, only you\\u2019ll get a video output instead. The early displays of Sora\\u2019s powers have sent the internet into a frenzy, and even after more than 10 years of seeing tech\\u2019s \\u201cnext big thing\\u201d come and go, I have to say it\\u2019s wildly impressive.\\n\\nThere\\u2019s every chance Sora could make its way into public beta or ChatGPT Plus availability before GPT-5 is even released, but even if that\\u2019s the case, it\\u2019ll be bigger and better than ever when OpenAI\\u2019s next-gen LLM does finally land.\\n\\n[Image 4: Screenshot of Sora video showing woman walking through Tokyo at night] \\n\\n### GPT-5 Could Usher in Project Q* Era of AGI \\n\\nOf course, in any discussion of GPT-5 it\\u2019s impossible to ignore the fact that, behind the scenes, OpenAI is working to develop not only its current suite of AI products, but also to bring forth a new breed of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) technologies currently dubbed \\u301049\\u2020Project Q*\\u3011.\\n\\nAGI is the term given when AI becomes \\u201csuperintelligent,\\u201d or gains the capacity to learn, reason and make decisions with human levels of cognition. It basically means that AGI systems are able to operate completely independent of learned information, thereby moving a step closer to being sentient beings.\\n\\nWhen current AI technologies can\\u2019t seem to stop themselves hallucinating information or generating the odd \\u301050\\u2020racist image\\u3011 for japes, it\\u2019s a hugely controversial prospect to say the least and is being opposed by many within the industry on ethical grounds.\\n\\nNevertheless, OpenAI is one of its chief proponents and with the next major GPT release, GPT-5, there\\u2019s a chance we\\u2019ll learn more about its ultimate aims for Project Q* AGI superintelligence, if not see a finished product, as per Altman\\u2019s own statements.\\n\\n### GPT-6 Also \\u201cConfirmed\\u201d by OpenAI \\n\\nWhy just get ahead of ourselves when we can get completely ahead of ourselves? In another statement, this time dated back to a Y Combinator event last September, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman referenced the development not only of GPT-5 but also its successor, GPT-6.\\n\\nHe stated that both were still a ways off in terms of release; both were targeting greater reliability at a lower cost; and as we just hinted above, both would fall short of being classified as AGI products.\\n\\n> Building in AI? Here are gems from a comprehensive talk by \\u301051\\u2020@sama\", \"pub_date\": null, \"extra\": {\"cited_message_idx\": 13, \"search_result_idx\": null, \"evidence_text\": \"source\", \"cloud_doc_url\": null}}}, {\"start_ix\": 393, \"end_ix\": 404, \"citation_format_type\": \"tether_og\", \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"webpage\", \"title\": \"GPT5: Everything You Should Know about New OpenAI Model\", \"url\": \"https://www.ongraph.com/gpt5/\", \"text\": \"\\nWe expect to see an extraordinary advancement in GPT-5.\\u00a0\\n\\n### 3. Improved reasoning\\n\\n[Image 3: GPT-5- Improved reasoning ]\\n\\nWe cannot say that AI cannot reason, with high computation and calculation power they are capable of generating human-like intelligence and interactions. This capability will be enhanced with the upcoming GPT models.\\u00a0\\n\\nSam Altman said they will be focusing on improving reasoning ability. The GPT-4o model has enhanced reasoning capability on par with GPT-4 Turbo with 87.2% accurate answers.\\u00a0\\n\\nHowever, GPT-5 will be trained on even more data and will show more accurate results with high-end computation.\\n\\n### 4. Larger context windows\\n\\nContext windows refer to how many tokens a model can process in a single go. A bigger context window means the model can absorb more data from given inputs, generating more accurate data. Currently, GPT-4o has a context window of 128,000 tokens which is smaller than\\u00a0 \\u301060\\u2020Google\\u2019s Gemini model\\u2019s\\u2020blog.google\\u3011 context window of up to 1 million tokens.\\u00a0\\n\\nAs per Alan Thompson\\u2019s prediction, there will be a whopping increase of 300x tokens. This could change the course of the Gemini model, offering notable advancement.\\u00a0\\n\\n### 5. Enhanced customization capabilities\\n\\nAltman said they will improve customization and personalization for GPT for every user. Currently, ChatGPT Plus or premium users can build and use custom settings, enabling users to personalize a GPT as per a specific task, from teaching a board game to helping kids complete their homework.\\n\\nIn the later interactions, developers can use user\\u2019s personal data, email, calendar, book appointments, and others. However, customization is not at the forefront of the next update, GPT-5, but you will see significant changes.\\n\\n### 6. Increased parameter size\\n\\nFrom GPT-1 to GPT-4, there has been a rise in the number of parameters they are trained on, GPT-5 is no exception. The size of these parameters affects how well the model can learn from data. OpenAI hasn\\u2019t revealed the exact number of parameters for GPT-5, but it\\u2019s estimated to have about 1.5 trillion parameters. This is a huge jump from GPT-3\\u2019s 175 billion and GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion.\\n\\n[Image 4: GPT-5- Increased Parameter Size ]\\n\\nAI expert \\u301061\\u2020Alan Thompson\\u2020lifearchitect.ai\\u3011, who advises Google and Microsoft, thinks GPT-5 might have 2-5 trillion parameters. He bases this on the increase in computing power and training time since GPT-4.\\n\\n### 7. Increased reliability\\n\\nImproving reliability is another focus of GPT\\u2019s improvement over the next two years, so you will see better reliable outputs with the Gpt-5 model.\\u00a0\\n\\nIn the case of the GPT-4, Altman says, \\u201cIf you ask GPT-4 the same question 10,000 times, one answer will probably be good, but it can\\u2019t always pick the best one. You\\u2019d want it to give the best response every time, so making it more reliable is important.\\u201d\\n\\nIn GPT-4o the reliability improved, reducing AI hallucinations. So, we are hoping GPT-5 to be more reliable and stable.\\n\\n[Also Read: \\u301062\\u2020How to Use AIML In Chatbot Development with Python?\\u3011]\\n\\n## When can we expect GPT5 release?\\n\\nIt is estimated to be in the market and available in 2024. Some are suggesting that the release is delayed due to the upcoming U.S. election, with a release date closer to November or December 2024.\\n\\nConsidering the training period of around 4-6 months (double of GPT-4 training time), the new model will take time in reinforcement learning, red teaming, and further testing before being released.\\n\\n## How much does GPT5 cost?\\n\\nIf OpenAI keeps its usual pricing, using GPT-5 will be expensive. ChatGPT with GPT-4 costs $20/month, while GPT-3.5 is free.\\n\\n[Image 5: How much does GPT-5 cost? ]\\n\\nFor the API, GPT-4 costs $30 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens (double for the 32k version). If GPT5 is as powerful as expected, it will cost more than previous models.\\n\\nHowever, the latest OpenAI model, GPT-4o, is much cheaper. It costs only $5 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. While pricing isn\\u2019t a big issue for large companies, this move makes it more accessible for individuals and small businesses.\\n\\n## The future of ChatGPT\\n\\nAs Altman said, we just scratched the surface of AI and this is just the beginning. There is much more to explore and improve the AI capabilities. GPT5 is just a step closer in the race of AI intelligence.\\u00a0\\n\\nAGI: The Ultimate Goal\\n\\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to AI that understands, learns, and performs tasks at a human-like level without extensive supervision. AGI has the potential to handle simple tasks, like ordering food online, as well as complex problem-solving requiring strategic planning. OpenAI\\u2019s dedication to AGI suggests a future where AI can independently manage tasks and make significant decisions based on user-defined goals.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### Q. What is GPT-5 and how does it differ from previous versions?\\u00a0\\n\\nGPT-5 is an upcoming OpenAI model with key features-\\n\\n  * Smarter and faster than GPT-4\\n  * Larger context window\\n  * Trained on larger data sets for accurate and reliable results\\n  * More\", \"pub_date\": null, \"extra\": {\"cited_message_idx\": 14, \"search_result_idx\": null, \"evidence_text\": \"source\", \"cloud_doc_url\": null}}}, {\"start_ix\": 620, \"end_ix\": 631, \"citation_format_type\": \"tether_og\", \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"webpage\", \"title\": \"Everything We Know About GPT-5 | DataCamp\", \"url\": \"https://www.datacamp.com/blog/everything-we-know-about-gpt-5\", \"text\": \"\\nTherefore, if GPT-5 follows a similar schedule, its launch could potentially extend to the end 2025. Even though this new launch seems far away, this does not necessarily mean that OpenAI won\\u2019t continue to improve GPT-4.\\n\\nOpenAI is most likely to keep improving GPT-4, and we might see the introduction of an intermediary update, GPT-4.5, as we already saw with GPT-3.5.\\n\\n## What Features Can We Expect From GPT-5?\\n\\nWith GPT-5's release possibly a year or two in the future, most predictions about its advancements are based on current trends shaped by Google and open-source AI initiatives. These developments give us valuable insights into the future direction of the industry.\\n\\nHowever, there are some first clues coming directly from the OpenAI core team. During Gates's interview, Altman highlighted that OpenAI's efforts would concentrate on enhancing reasoning abilities and incorporating video processing capabilities.\\n\\nSo, let\\u2019s try to make a little sense of it all and discuss some key enhancements expected from GPT-5.\\n\\n### Parameter size\\n\\nWhile the exact parameter size of GPT-4 remains under wraps, there\\u2019s an ongoing trend toward more complex and capable models. Most sources indicate the number might be around 1.5 trillion parameters.\\n\\n[Image 1: Image by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution.]\\n\\nImage by Author. GPT family number of parameters evolution. \\n\\nIf this trajectory continues, GPT-5 could redefine the limits of current LLMs, offering an unprecedented size.\\n\\n### Multimodality\\n\\nGiven that the existing GPT-4 model \\u301051\\u2020already supports speech\\u3011 and \\u301052\\u2020image functionalities,\\u3011 the integration of video processing emerges as a natural progression for GPT-5. We\\u2019ve already seen Google start to experiment with this feature in its Gemini model, so it\\u2019s only a matter of time before competition forces OpenAI to innovate as well.\\n\\nTherefore, GPT-5 could improve current GPT-4 multimodal capabilities and add new features like video integration, generating a pivotal shift in how we interact with AI, enabling more natural and versatile forms of communication.\\n\\n### From Chatbot to Agent\\n\\nThe transition from chatbots to fully autonomous agents is another exciting frontier. Imagine if you could assign menial tasks or jobs to a GPT-powered app. This could actually become a reality if OpenAI keeps integrating third-party services. We\\u2019ve already seen the introduction of \\u301053\\u2020Custom GPTs\\u3011, and this will likely continue to develop.\\n\\nThis new feature would allow GPT-5 to connect to various services and perform actions in the world seamlessly, acting on behalf of users to accomplish tasks without direct human oversight. For instance, we could ask an autonomous agent to buy our groceries based on our own dietary preferences.\\n\\n### Better accuracy\\n\\nWith each iteration, the accuracy of GPT models has improved, making them more reliable in understanding context and generating appropriate responses. A next generation in the GPT models would mean an increase in its training dataset size and variety.\\n\\nThe current \\u301054\\u2020GPT-4 model is 40% better than its predecessor GPT-3\\u2020openai.com\\u3011, so GPT-5 is expected to continue this trend, reducing errors and enhancing the fidelity of its interactions.\\n\\n### Increased context windows\\n\\nOne of the limitations of current models is the size of the context window they can consider for generating responses. Given that GPT-5 might be trained with a larger amount of data, it is anticipated to have an expanded context window, allowing it to understand and reference larger portions of text, leading to more coherent and contextually relevant outputs.\\n\\n### Cost-effective use of the OpenAI API\\n\\nAs newer models emerge, we can also anticipate a reduction in the cost of using the OpenAI API, making technologies like GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 more accessible. A launch of GPT-5 could mean that GPT-4 will become accessible and cheaper to use.\\n\\nThis democratization of access could spur a wave of innovation, enabling a broader range of developers and organizations to integrate advanced AI into their applications.\\n\\nOnce it becomes cheaper and more accessible, the GPT models could become more proficient at performing complex tasks like coding or research. If you haven\\u2019t tried OpenAI\\u2019s API yet, I strongly recommend you follow DataCamp\\u2019s\\u301055\\u2020 guide to the OpenAI API\\u3011 to get a taste of it.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nWhile we eagerly await concrete details about GPT-5, it's crucial to remember that our current discussions are rooted in speculation and mere prediction based on historical facts, AI general trends, and some small clues that OpenAI\\u2019s team seems to share.\\n\\nHistory suggests that we may see incremental updates, such as a GPT-4.5, before the arrival of GPT-5 in the mid-term.\\n\\nRegardless of the timeline, the evolution of the GPT series continues to captivate the imagination, promising a future where AI's potential is limited only by our ability to envision its applications.\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re eager to get started exploring all that GPT models have to offer, start with our \\u301056\\u2020Introduction to ChatGPT\\u3011 course or, if you\\u2019re already familiar with the model, our webinar on \\u301057\\u2020Using ChatGPT\\u2019s Advanced Data Analysis\\u3011.\\n\\n* * *\\n\\n[Image 2: Photo of Josep Ferrer]\\n\\nAuthor\\n\\nJosep Ferrer\\n\\n\\u301058\\u2020.css-18aqazp{-webkit-align-items:center;-webkit-box-align:center;-ms-flex-align:center;align-items:center;border-radius:50%;height:28px;-webkit-box-pack:center;-ms-flex-pack:center;-webkit-justify-content:center;justify\", \"pub_date\": null, \"extra\": {\"cited_message_idx\": 12, \"search_result_idx\": null, \"evidence_text\": \"source\", \"cloud_doc_url\": null}}}, {\"start_ix\": 631, \"end_ix\": 642, \"citation_format_type\": \"tether_og\", \"metadata\": {\"type\": \"webpage\", \"title\": \"GPT5: Everything You Should Know about New OpenAI Model\", \"url\": \"https://www.ongraph.com/gpt5/\", \"text\": \"\\nWe expect to see an extraordinary advancement in GPT-5.\\u00a0\\n\\n### 3. Improved reasoning\\n\\n[Image 3: GPT-5- Improved reasoning ]\\n\\nWe cannot say that AI cannot reason, with high computation and calculation power they are capable of generating human-like intelligence and interactions. This capability will be enhanced with the upcoming GPT models.\\u00a0\\n\\nSam Altman said they will be focusing on improving reasoning ability. The GPT-4o model has enhanced reasoning capability on par with GPT-4 Turbo with 87.2% accurate answers.\\u00a0\\n\\nHowever, GPT-5 will be trained on even more data and will show more accurate results with high-end computation.\\n\\n### 4. Larger context windows\\n\\nContext windows refer to how many tokens a model can process in a single go. A bigger context window means the model can absorb more data from given inputs, generating more accurate data. Currently, GPT-4o has a context window of 128,000 tokens which is smaller than\\u00a0 \\u301060\\u2020Google\\u2019s Gemini model\\u2019s\\u2020blog.google\\u3011 context window of up to 1 million tokens.\\u00a0\\n\\nAs per Alan Thompson\\u2019s prediction, there will be a whopping increase of 300x tokens. This could change the course of the Gemini model, offering notable advancement.\\u00a0\\n\\n### 5. Enhanced customization capabilities\\n\\nAltman said they will improve customization and personalization for GPT for every user. Currently, ChatGPT Plus or premium users can build and use custom settings, enabling users to personalize a GPT as per a specific task, from teaching a board game to helping kids complete their homework.\\n\\nIn the later interactions, developers can use user\\u2019s personal data, email, calendar, book appointments, and others. However, customization is not at the forefront of the next update, GPT-5, but you will see significant changes.\\n\\n### 6. Increased parameter size\\n\\nFrom GPT-1 to GPT-4, there has been a rise in the number of parameters they are trained on, GPT-5 is no exception. The size of these parameters affects how well the model can learn from data. OpenAI hasn\\u2019t revealed the exact number of parameters for GPT-5, but it\\u2019s estimated to have about 1.5 trillion parameters. This is a huge jump from GPT-3\\u2019s 175 billion and GPT-2\\u2019s 1.5 billion.\\n\\n[Image 4: GPT-5- Increased Parameter Size ]\\n\\nAI expert \\u301061\\u2020Alan Thompson\\u2020lifearchitect.ai\\u3011, who advises Google and Microsoft, thinks GPT-5 might have 2-5 trillion parameters. He bases this on the increase in computing power and training time since GPT-4.\\n\\n### 7. Increased reliability\\n\\nImproving reliability is another focus of GPT\\u2019s improvement over the next two years, so you will see better reliable outputs with the Gpt-5 model.\\u00a0\\n\\nIn the case of the GPT-4, Altman says, \\u201cIf you ask GPT-4 the same question 10,000 times, one answer will probably be good, but it can\\u2019t always pick the best one. You\\u2019d want it to give the best response every time, so making it more reliable is important.\\u201d\\n\\nIn GPT-4o the reliability improved, reducing AI hallucinations. So, we are hoping GPT-5 to be more reliable and stable.\\n\\n[Also Read: \\u301062\\u2020How to Use AIML In Chatbot Development with Python?\\u3011]\\n\\n## When can we expect GPT5 release?\\n\\nIt is estimated to be in the market and available in 2024. Some are suggesting that the release is delayed due to the upcoming U.S. election, with a release date closer to November or December 2024.\\n\\nConsidering the training period of around 4-6 months (double of GPT-4 training time), the new model will take time in reinforcement learning, red teaming, and further testing before being released.\\n\\n## How much does GPT5 cost?\\n\\nIf OpenAI keeps its usual pricing, using GPT-5 will be expensive. ChatGPT with GPT-4 costs $20/month, while GPT-3.5 is free.\\n\\n[Image 5: How much does GPT-5 cost? ]\\n\\nFor the API, GPT-4 costs $30 per million input tokens and $60 per million output tokens (double for the 32k version). If GPT5 is as powerful as expected, it will cost more than previous models.\\n\\nHowever, the latest OpenAI model, GPT-4o, is much cheaper. It costs only $5 per million input tokens and $15 per million output tokens. While pricing isn\\u2019t a big issue for large companies, this move makes it more accessible for individuals and small businesses.\\n\\n## The future of ChatGPT\\n\\nAs Altman said, we just scratched the surface of AI and this is just the beginning. There is much more to explore and improve the AI capabilities. GPT5 is just a step closer in the race of AI intelligence.\\u00a0\\n\\nAGI: The Ultimate Goal\\n\\nArtificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to AI that understands, learns, and performs tasks at a human-like level without extensive supervision. AGI has the potential to handle simple tasks, like ordering food online, as well as complex problem-solving requiring strategic planning. OpenAI\\u2019s dedication to AGI suggests a future where AI can independently manage tasks and make significant decisions based on user-defined goals.\\n\\n## FAQs\\n\\n### Q.

        "content": "Solipsism is a philosophical concept that posits that only one's own mind is sure to exist. It argues that knowledge of anything outside one's own mind is unsure and that the external world and other minds cannot be known and might not exist outside the mind. This idea challenges the notion of objective reality and focuses on subjective experience. Solipsism can be divided into:\n\n1. **Metaphysical Solipsism**: The belief that the self is the only existing reality and everything outside of one's own mind is an illusion.\n2. **Epistemological Solipsism**: The view that knowledge outside of one's own mind is uncertain and that one cannot be sure of the existence of anything beyond their own thoughts.\n3. **Methodological Solipsism**: A principle in philosophy of mind and cognitive science that treats the mind's processes as occurring independently of external factors.\n\nSolipsism raises deep questions about the nature of reality, consciousness, and perception, often intersecting with discussions on the limits of human knowledge and the nature of existence.",

        "content": "Here are some lesser-known facts about the Roman Empire:\n\n1. **Concrete Innovation**: The Romans were pioneers in the use of concrete, which allowed them to build enduring structures like the Pantheon and the Colosseum. Their concrete was highly durable, even in seawater, due to the use of volcanic ash.\n\n2. **Public Toilets and Hygiene**: Public toilets in Rome were communal, with long benches and no partitions. They also had a sophisticated system of aqueducts and sewers, showing their advanced understanding of public health and sanitation.\n\n3. **The Circus Maximus**: This massive stadium was primarily used for chariot races and could hold up to 150,000 spectators, making it one of the largest sports venues ever constructed.\n\n4. **Roman Women\u2019s Rights**: Roman women had more rights than in many other ancient societies. They could own property, run businesses, and were entitled to a share of their family's wealth.\n\n5. **Roman Firefighters**: The Roman Empire had a professional fire brigade known as the \"Vigiles.\" Established by Emperor Augustus, they served both as firefighters and night watchmen.\n\n6. **Postal System**: The Romans developed an extensive postal system called the \"Cursus Publicus,\" which facilitated communication across the vast empire. It used relay stations with fresh horses for couriers.\n\n7. **Multicultural Society**: The Roman Empire was highly multicultural, incorporating diverse peoples and cultures from Europe, Africa, and Asia. This diversity influenced Roman art, cuisine, and daily life.\n\n8. **Londinium**: Modern-day London was founded by the Romans around 43 AD and was originally called Londinium. It became an important commercial center in Roman Britain.\n\n9. **Roman Cuisine**: The Romans enjoyed a varied diet, including exotic foods like flamingo tongues, dormice, and garum (a fermented fish sauce). Feasts were elaborate, and meals often included entertainment.\n\n10. **The Julian Calendar**: Introduced by Julius Caesar in 45 BC, the Julian calendar was a reform of the Roman calendar. It included the leap year system and was the precursor to the modern Gregorian calendar.\n\nThese lesser-known facts highlight the Roman Empire's advanced engineering, societal structure, and influence on modern civilization.",
